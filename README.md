Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns based on various factors such as **age, gender, passenger class, and family presence**. The dataset provides details about passengers, including demographic, socio-economic, and survival information.

The analysis is done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, with data visualization and statistical summaries. The goal is to identify **key factors that influenced survival rates** during the disaster.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`titanic_analysis.ipynb`) â€“ Includes full code, data cleaning steps, and visualizations.
- **PDF Report** (`titanic_report.pdf`) â€“ Summarizes findings and insights from the analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Gender:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Passenger Class (Pclass):** Survival rates were highest among 1st class passengers and lowest among 3rd class passengers.
- **Age:** Children had better survival chances compared to adults.
- **Family:** Passengers traveling with family (SibSp/Parch > 0) had slightly better survival odds.
- **Embarkation Port:** Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival rates.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **CSV dataset** from Kaggle's Titanic competition
